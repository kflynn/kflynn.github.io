        I see a lot of graphs of cumulative COVID-19 cases over time. While they definitely 
        play well on TV with their dramatic upward curve, what I want from data visualization
        is to improve my situational awareness: are things getting better? are they getting
        worse? is that light up ahead the end of a tunnel, or a train? Graphing cumulative
        counts doesn't seem to help much with that, because the counts can keep growing for
        a long time even while we're bringing the situation under control.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        What felt more useful to me was the rate of change, rather than the absolute number. 
        We humans aren't great at looking at a raw-count graph and knowing the rate, though, 
        especially as the numbers get large. So I assembled these graphs centered around the
        rates, rather than the counts:

        <ul>
        <li><span style="color: rgb(255, 99, 132)">Red lines</span> show the doubling time of deaths from COVID-19.</li>
        <li><span style="color: rgb(54, 162, 235)">Blue lines</span> show the doubling time of confirmed COVID-19 cases.</li>
        <li>For Massachusetts, the <span style="color: rgb(255, 159, 64)">orange line</span> shows the doubling time of COVID-19 hospitalizations.</li>
        <li>The grey background shows the count of deaths, for context.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        <i>Doubling time</i> is calculated over the seven-day window that ended on the date
        being plotted. The higher the value, the faster the number is doubling, so 
        <strong>lower values are better</strong>. Once the number starts actually decreasing over
        time, the graph will show halving times (and, again, lower is better).
    </p>

    <p>
        Two final cautions: first, I'm not an epidemiologist, I just think we're not good at intuiting
        about exponential growth rates. Second, when the numbers are small, the rates are very likely
        to be much less stable and thus much less useful for reasoning about. Use with caution.

      The fine print:

      <ul>
        <li>No data are graphed for times during which a given location reported no deaths or cases.</li>
        <li>No point will be plotted if the number was constant over the whole seven-day window.</li>
        <li>The primary data source is the <a style="text-decoration: none" href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19">Johns Hopkins CSSE data</a>, 
            which is updated daily.</li>
        <li>Massachusetts hospitalization data is from <a style="text-decoration: none" href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/covid-19-cases-quarantine-and-monitoring">ma.gov</a>.</li>
        <li>Massachusetts and Johns Hopkins either don't have a proper data channel, or possibly John Hopkins
            lags Massachusetts by a day? I've reached out to the Massachusetts Department of Health about this,
            and will comment here as I learn more.</li>
        <li>Before 13 April 2020, Massachusetts reported only confirmed cases in the hospitalization counts.
            On 13 April 2020, they started including presumed positive COVID patients as well. This manifests
            as a significant jump in the graphs.</li>
        <li>Massachusetts quietly restated their hospitalization counts when they released their new dashboard
            on 20 April 2020. The numbers graphed for Massachusetts reflect the restating.</li>
        <li>Massachusetts started reporting hospitalizations by county as of 14 April 2020, but the first week
            has been really tough to be sure of the data quality. In particular, Middlesex and Suffolk data for
            17 and 18 April are missing entirely.</li>
        <li>The sharp drop in Massachusetts hospitalizations on 20 April is surreal, but so far looks real based
            on other information I have from Partners Health -- anecdotally, their hospitalizations slowed a lot
            over the weekend of 18-19 April. I'm still keeping an eye on that.</li>
        <li>I would love hospitalization data for other regions, but I don't have it.</li>
      </ul>
